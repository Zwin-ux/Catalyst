# TODO (as of 2025-04-28)

## Immediate Technical Tasks
- [ ] **Fix Remaining TypeScript Syntax Errors:**
    - Unmatched or misplaced brackets/parentheses in `bot.ts` (see lines 271, 272, 728).
    - Ensure all event handlers and function blocks are properly closed.
    - Remove or refactor any unreachable or broken code blocks.
- [ ] **Linting:**
    - Address any remaining implicit `any` types or type errors.
    - Clean up duplicate imports and type guards.
- [ ] **Test Bot:**
    - Ensure the bot starts and runs without crashing.
    - Test playful event, faction, and spotlight timeline features end-to-end.
    - Validate dynamic channel and voting features.

## Enhancements & Features
- [ ] Expand playful event types (plot twists, showdowns, aura-offs, spotlight challenges) in the Dynamic Event Generator.
- [ ] Add more analytics and timeline summaries (top spotlight users, creative rivalries, etc.).
- [ ] Polish user feedback and error handling (especially for failed commands or missing permissions).
- [ ] All major core mechanics and docs now use positive, creative language and playful systems.
- [ ] Improve onboarding and help messages for new users.
- [ ] Consider web dashboard for analytics and moderation.

## Documentation
- [ ] Update `/docs` with new features and architecture notes.
- [ ] Add code comments and type annotations for maintainability.
