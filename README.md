**Catalyst** is a modular, fully interactive Discord bot engine for gamifying communities through playful, creative events (plot twists, showdowns, aura-offs, and spotlights), voting, and dynamic channels.

### Core Features (Goals for the project)
- Persistent world state: users, factions, and playful event history (plot twists, showdowns, spotlights) are saved and evolve in real time.
- Dynamic channel management (`hub`, `config`, `powers`, `mods`, `timeline`).
- Emoji voting and interactive buttons on all major events and proposals.
- Plugin proposals and voting.
- Spotlight timeline and playful analytics with leaderboard and event summaries.
- No slash commands neededâ€”users interact via buttons, emoji, and dynamic messages.
- Positive, community-focused design: All mechanics encourage creativity, collaboration, and fun rather than competition or negativity.





## Next Steps
- **Fix all remaining TypeScript errors and lint issues.**
- **Test the bot end-to-end:** drama, faction, and timeline features.
- **Expand dramatic events and analytics.**
- **Polish onboarding and user feedback.**
