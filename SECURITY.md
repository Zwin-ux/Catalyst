## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Catalyst, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for the vulnerability.
2. Instead, send an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with a detailed description of the vulnerability.
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue, if possible.
4. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
5. We will work on a fix and keep you updated on our progress.
6. Once the issue is resolved, we will release a security update and credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Security Best Practices

- Always keep your dependencies up to date.
- Run the bot with the minimum required permissions.
- Use environment variables for sensitive information (tokens, API keys, etc.).
- Regularly review the bot's permissions and audit logs.
- Follow the principle of least privilege when setting up the bot's permissions.

## Responsible Disclosure

We are committed to working with security researchers to resolve any vulnerabilities. We ask that you:

- Give us reasonable time to address the issue before any public disclosure.
- Do not exploit the vulnerability for any reason.
- Do not access or modify user data without explicit permission.
- Keep all information about the vulnerability confidential until we've had time to address it.

## Credits

We appreciate the security research community's efforts to keep our users safe. Properly reported vulnerabilities will be acknowledged in our release notes.
